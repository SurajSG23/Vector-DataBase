# Vector Database

A **Vector Database** stores and searches data based on **meaning** ‚Äî not just exact values.

It stores **vector embeddings** ‚Äî which are **numerical representations of text, images, or audio** that capture their **semantic meaning** (how similar or related they are).

So instead of asking:

> ‚ÄúFind records where name = ‚ÄòSuraj‚Äô‚Äù

You can ask:

> ‚ÄúFind texts similar in meaning to this sentence‚Äù

It‚Äôs used in **AI, NLP, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems for semantic search, recommendation, or chatbot memory.

### Comparison: SQL vs NoSQL vs Vector DB

| Feature           | **SQL (Relational DB)**           | **NoSQL (Non-Relational DB)**      | **Vector DB**                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Type**     | Tables (rows & columns)           | JSON, key-value, document, graph   | Vectors (arrays of numbers)                             |
| **Schema**        | Fixed schema                      | Flexible / dynamic schema          | No fixed schema (stores embeddings)                     |
| **Query Type**    | Exact match, joins, filters       | Key-based or document queries      | Similarity search (find closest vectors)                |
| **Example Query** | `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1;` | `db.users.find({ name: "Suraj" })` | ‚ÄúFind vectors similar to this embedding‚Äù                |
| **Use Case**      | Banking, transactions, inventory  | Social media, e-commerce, logs     | AI search, chatbots, recommendations                    |
| **Examples**      | MySQL, PostgreSQL                 | MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase       | Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, Chroma                       |
| **Scaling**       | Vertical (add more power)         | Horizontal (add more servers)      | Built for horizontal scaling and fast similarity search |

### Simple Analogy

* **SQL** ‚Üí Like a spreadsheet with strict columns (good for structured data).
* **NoSQL** ‚Üí Like folders of JSON files (good for flexible or large data).
* **Vector DB** ‚Üí Like a smart memory that finds *similar* things instead of exact matches.

# Vector Space

A **vector space** is a mathematical concept where **vectors live**.

* A **vector** is basically a list of numbers that represent **something in space**.
* A **vector space** is a set of these vectors where you can do **two main things** safely:

  1. **Add vectors together**
  2. **Multiply vectors by numbers (scalars)**

Think of it as a **playground for vectors** where all the rules of addition and scaling work.

---

### üîπ Simple Example

Imagine 2D vectors:

* Vector A = `[2, 3]`
* Vector B = `[1, 5]`

In a vector space:

1. **Addition works:**

```
A + B = [2+1, 3+5] = [3, 8]
```

2. **Scalar multiplication works:**

```
2 * A = [2*2, 2*3] = [4, 6]
```

---

### üîπ Why Vector Spaces Matter

* They help us **represent things as numbers** in a structured way.
* In **AI and vector databases**, vector spaces are used to represent **words, images, or documents as vectors**.
  Example:

  * ‚ÄúCat‚Äù ‚Üí `[0.2, 0.7, 0.1, ...]`
  * ‚ÄúDog‚Äù ‚Üí `[0.3, 0.6, 0.1, ...]`
  * ‚ÄúCar‚Äù ‚Üí `[0.9, 0.1, 0.5, ...]`

Now, **vectors that are ‚Äúclose‚Äù in space mean the things are similar in meaning**.

---

### üîπ Analogy

* Imagine each vector is a **point in space**.
* Vector space is like a **giant 3D or multi-dimensional map** where you can measure **distances between points**.
* Nearby points = similar meaning / related things.
